(Make it long):</span> Hi, my in-game name is I_AM_A_NERD_123 but you probably know me as Elsa or Elzabeth. I'm applying for Mediator and I thank you in advance for reading this. Please take your time and evaluate this in all fairness.<br/><br/> I want to be Mediator because I would like to make indistinct a better place for anyone, I could probably help keep cyber-bullying down to a minimum. I want to be a helpful staff member, but, not be a staff member that watches over your shoulder and stalks you. cyber bullying is a cause for many severe problems like suicide, cutting yourself, and lack of self esteem. Greifing is one of Indistinct's biggest problems, greifing has been at a high lately, and I think I could propose an idea for a spawn system. A spawn system that makes you read the rules and answer a short quiz to make sure you understand the rules and the rank system.<br/><br/> I plan to use my power to be a bigger force not just for Indistinct, but as an example of a good person, to change one person's outlook and then that person to change someone else's outlook.We have all felt like no one wanted us,but we have to at least want to be around each other.We should all feel like we fit in every once and a while. We should be able to make jokes and make one person day by making them laugh. Sometimes I feel like the whole world is against me everyone on indistinct makes me feel better and that's another great thing about Indistinct.<br/><br/> Mediators are Indistinct's &quot;helper&quot; rank, so I think <span style="text-decoration: underline">almost</span> anyone who apples should get a chance. If they abuse, you demote them, if they do well, you let them apply for moderator. what I mean by this is, all I need i just one chance to prove myself. If I fail you can go ahead and demote me, I just think i can make a difference. I would look up to and follow the examples of lazysmurf, sammy, and meed. Lazy is sensitive, cool, and amazing, but he knows how to his job very well. Sammy can stop a bad guest at the door and turn him or her around before you can utter &quot;welcome.&quot; Meed may be very quiet but he knows when to jump in and do his job. If you give me one chance you would be surprised at me. I've become more mature, and, on a separate note, I know how to use HawkEye. I put in a lot of effort in the smallest things to make it the best it can be.<br/><br/> Please, give me this one chance, so I can show you what I can do I took my time writing this to show how much I care. I really do care about Indistinct.

<div class="content">I like how it is very long! :3 I wasn't not part of the examples, but mkay <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink"/> <br/><br/>I think you should propose your spawn idea anyway even if Mediator is not your rank, because if you think it would help the server, then I think most everyone will as well. <br/><br/>I totally agree, griefing is at a complete high and we definitely need a slight more staff. <br/><br/>As for all the &quot;helpers&quot; for everyone to get a chance, they are getting a chance. Not only do they get the chance to prove themselves, but also they have a chance to achieve the rank. You're whole Indistinct &quot;Career&quot; as a Guest-Dedicated (or Contributor, Contributor+) is the moment to prove you have what it takes. When you think you're ready, you apply, which you have applied many times, so you are definitely feeling worthy to be Mediator. <br/><br/>I would definitely like you to be a Med, but as for other people, when they just apply, I don't think it would be a good idea to just accept everyone so quickly like that. <br/><br/>I like your point about cyber bullying, and I'm sure you would do great with stopping people from bullying like that as well. I wish you very good luck and I hope you get that chance to shine!</div>
