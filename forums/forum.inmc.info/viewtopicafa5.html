<div class="content">Guys, I feel that this staff thing is getting out of hand now. I remember a year ago last year we had about 5 staff members and the server needed more staff. Pretty much at that time no one cared about joining staff and just played Minecraft, it was cool. Overtime, people started applying and it started getting choatic, the battle for staff. Now seriously, now that most of us have all the powers, that is the PROBLEM. Everyone pretty much is staff. I say this is a problem because the only players on, is us oldtimers and staff, no new people. We are too busy just playing with our powers and hanging out or waiting for a response on an app. that bankruptcy snuck up behind us all. We were distracted by our powers that we didn't notice our funds. Also since most of us have the powers, now we are just leveled up to each other and there is no one to MODERATE. The server totally opposite from what it was a year ago. A year ago the server was filled with guests and members (us) and few staff but with the money to run the server. Now, its just powerful players with powerful ranks (us) and a lot of staff with no one to moderate. We just hang out screwing around for months without contribution and now, we are going down next month. I blame all of us for letting this happen. Please just think about this. Don't think that I don't count myself for blame because bankruptcy was just as a surprise for me as for you. Now that the rumor is true, all we do is just type a sad face and trade emails or whateves and wait for judgement day.</div>

There is never really a limit. You need staff to help with the server<br/>2. It's not a battle for staff <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz"/> A battle for staff would be people going on other people's applications and going &quot;This person sucks. Don't accept.&quot;<br/>3. Bankruptcy can happen to anyone at any time. Sometimes, family or personal matters come up and money becomes scarce.<br/>4. I agree that some staff members don't moderate or don't get on as often, but a few of us actually do our job. That's like if your a teacher, and a kid is being rude in your class, and you punish everyone.<br/>5. SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE MONEY TO contribute. &gt;:I<br/>6. Dude, if the server closes down, how are we gonna stay in contact. It's like the zombie invasion is coming in 1 day and you say we shouldn't meet up or something.<br/>7. Sorry if I seem angry or mad, but I've had a rough day :/</div>

<div class="content">Rough days should not concern in game things. Also, I have noticed many people (including yourself) DESPERATE for a role in staff. When you posted this, I could only think that you wanted to be staff as well. And you can't say we aren't getting new members, because we are.</div>

<div class="content">I have been wanting staff for some time but I don't think I have any sliver of a chance, besides does this look like an application? The new requirements pretty much is directed to me and some others and I just have to accept the fact that I won't be joining staff anytime soon. But seeing how much staff is being added and promoted nowadays, I feel like sh*t when I think of how many times I applied last year. I sort of see the stream of applications as a battle of who can get accepted first. What I ment about we are just trading emails is that we are all sitting around for judgement day without trying to do something, but yeah not everyone is capable of donating. I have probably achieved many haters in the process of posting this topic.</div>

<div class="content">Also Keags when you applied, you were accepted in a matter of hours. You got the opportunity that at the time many of us wanted including me. I did get jealous of you but I shouldn't be because you did your job very well and in a mature way. When I saw how well you were doing, I felt like even if I was part of staff, I would be a horrible staff member (Dtiger approves probs) compared to you. You also got Mod which was an even greater achievement and you truly deserved it. When I saw your topic of demotion, I got mad. You were willing to step down for others who you thought that hated you. But ignore that thought because you would do a better job than them and me anyways. When I think about how well you do with your job, and how badly I would do in staff, I feel ok where you are now Keag, in staff. Its ok to choose that you think that i'm lying or being honest but don't throw away the opportunity that most have failed to get.</div>

<div class="content">I only asked for the demotion (publicly) to show that I don't NEED this power of Mod. It was just simply a desire and an achievement. And it wasn't a thought, people have recently said to me that they hated me when I got Mediator. I don't know why, because it was all fair game, but oh well. And I do agree, a lot of staff is appearing and we have very few Regular Players.</div>
