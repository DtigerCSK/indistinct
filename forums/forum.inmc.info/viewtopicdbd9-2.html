<div class="content">Here it goes -<br/><br/>1. Ingame name: keagan88080<br/><br/>2. How long have you been playing on the server? (Should be 2 or more months): Exactly 2 months<br/><br/>3. How long have you been the mediator rank? (Should be at least 1 month): A month and a half<br/><br/>4. Play time (Should be more than 150 hours): 268 hours of play time<br/><br/>5. Why you deserve Mod, and what you will do with it. (Make it long): Well, to kick start this part, I have been a really good Mediator (I think) who has played a lot and helped out in many situations. There are many times, many, where I find griefs, stolen items, or rule-breakers and LATER have to report it since I can't ban. I can always jail, but sometimes, it doesn't get through their mind. It just goes in one ear and out the other. I have been VERY active (I mean, 268 hours in 2 months is a lot) and I love helping people out. The reigns on my leash would be loosened a little to see what I can achieve as a Moderator as well. As I was a Mediator, I learned the ways of how other people coped with banning, muting, and other (criminal-like) things.<br/><br/>Of course, cyber-bullying is a major issue, and I don't have to promote it, because I feel like all staff (and players at the least) work to keep Indistinct (v2) very safe from that type of pain/drama. I have settled a lot and I don't need to advertise how I would work to stop cyber-bullying, because I feel like I have (and will) keep doing what I do best.<br/><br/>It would be a great experience to be a Moderator on Indistinct as well. Not only because of the attention it brings, but when someone says they need help, I get that feeling like , &quot;That is why I'm here!&quot; People may have grudges against me, and think I am wrong for the job, and I respect that. Instead of keeping it and hiding it from me, tell me in the comments or /mail (or /msg if I am online) on the server. As a Moderator, I would want to help patrol the &quot;streets&quot; and get rid of the criminals and wrong-doers from Indistinct.<br/><br/>P.S. I know I have had my times where I can't help, but I am about to move permanently, but I will still be as active as I am to this day. I hope you enjoyed (or not that's cool to) reading my app, and just type up a comment that you wanna say! Love you all, have a nice night! (Or day, depends on where you are)</div>
