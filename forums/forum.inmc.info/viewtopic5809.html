<div class="content">I'm mostly addressing this to keagan, but if this is going in than try to stop it.<br/><br/>Yesterday, July 22, lots of, eh, stuff, went down. <br/><br/>First thing that happened:<br/>I delivered a message sent from Liz(iamnerd) to Sammy not saying the kindest things...<br/><br/>then, I decided to defend her a little since, you know, I wasn't here for everything that went down in terms of Liz and, well, dating. And well I think she is a nice person<br/><br/>Then everybody turned on me after calling Liz a &quot;whiny bitch&quot; and all the sort. Most prominent were the action of Keagan but I'll get to that later. Idk what spooters said but I know I had just been fed up with him for just being a general jerk to me so I said a few mean things which I'm sure he will post a link to in the description. <br/><br/>After this everybody thought I was agreeing with Liz, but I don't. I was arguing for more hr dignity than her beliefs. <br/><br/><br/>And then, for lack of a better way to say it, shit went down.<br/><br/>Keagan asked this ridiculous question &quot;would you stand up against Sammy&quot; as I'm like no and then he just started to tell like &quot;ANSWER THE FUCKING QUESTION&quot; and shit like that. Anyways, that was scarring. <br/><br/>Then later I got banned for wha I said to spoot which I understand so this isn't a ban appeal. Anyways...<br/><br/>Don't let this happen around the server anymore. I mean seriously guys, how can we sink this low and turn against eachother like that... <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad"/></div>

<div class="content">It wasn't a ridiculous question, it was supposed to be very serious. And besides, that wasn't the question. The question was 'How do you feel about being and Nerd's side and standing up against Sammy&quot;. Stop spreading lies. Second of all, you called Sputters some nasty things, which was unacceptable. I called you out and made you feel bad because you were being a little dick and a smartass. On your post, you make me look a fool; when in reality, before I asked you the question, you called me something I did not like. Now, even though I was a little rough (and un-needed) my actions should have been saved for Nerd herself, instead of the messenger (you). I did not ban you, Sputters did because he did not like being called what you called him and he had nothing to do with it anyway. Another thing, many people have stooped low and gossiped about each other. You say you aren't like that, but you are.</div>

<div class="content">Also Terq, I have a question for you.<br/><br/>If Stevie was really going to &quot;take a stand&quot; against me, then why wasn't she on there talking to me? Why did she send you? If she really &quot;wasn't afraid anymore,&quot; she would've carted her ass on there and spoke her mind to me.</div>
