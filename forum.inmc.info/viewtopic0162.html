<div class="content">Hey guys. I know that a lot of people don't like chuble (And please don't spam about how mean he is), but let's try to tone it down. I know he's done mean stuff, but if he isn't being mean to you then don't be mean to him. I know you don't like him, but that's no reason to be mean to him. I don't mean be like 'choobl I &lt;3 u pls marry meh', but just try to get along with him. <br/><br/><br/>Thanks</div>

<div class="content">Well you can be pretty rude. But you could try to talk to people in a pleasant way like you used to, like when I came on of I the server. Really, I was new on the server, and you let me build a little house by yours, because I couldn't find any trees XD that was funny <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"/> and very nice, you should try to be like that again, everyone remembers and misses how you used to be.</div>

<div class="content">Well, that makes two of us, two misfits, because the day I finally acted like my self, the rudest words I've ever heard we're delivered to me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry for caring, I'm sorry for being nice, and finally acting like myself, because no one likes it when I'm being myself, for some reason, maybe it's because I don't care about myself, only everyone else, but the things that we're said to me hurt, allot, and I'm done, I can't help you guys any more. I'm sorry, I'm really truly sorry, to everyone.</div>

<div class="content">Now you both realize how I felt when I was against everyone. I tried saying sorry, but sorry doesn't cut it anymore. And Chuble will not get another chance. He has had too many chances and Nerd, you say a lot of things that hurt to, everyone does, so no one has a reason to complain. Things were said, and it has been settled and it doesn't need to be dragged further.</div>

<div class="content">Talk about online flaming. I agree with Keagan. People don't like me that much but I only act in response when I feel threatened or antagonized. It would be nice if people would stop being full of themselves and start taking responsibility for what THEY do, not pointing out what others do.<br/><br/>Though, I'm not saying that if someone is being rude you shouldn't point it out. If you said something mean to someone, and they something rude back, you can't just run to a staff member and say &quot;this person was being rude to me!&quot; because thats not cool. I know I'm rude, but most of the time in response to being socially bullied. Now, lets see if other people has the character to admit their falts and start accepting what they do wrong. It's time for a reform.</div>
