<h3>Keagan's Mediator Application</h3>
<div class="date"><img src="styles/oxygen/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post"/>Posted: <strong>Tue Jan 21, 2014 10:03 am</strong></div>

<div class="content">1. Ingame name: keagan8808<br/><br/>2. Rank: Dedicated<br/><br/>3. Age (Should be 13 or older): 14<br/><br/>4. How long have you been playing on the server?:<br/>- I joined the server (play.inmc.info) on the 7th of January.<br/>- I registered an account on the 8th of January (2014)<br/><br/>5. Play time:<br/>- 5 days, 21 hours. (141 hours)<br/><br/>6. Are you active on the forums and/or on our teamspeak server?<br/>- Yes. I do believe I am fairly active on each.<br/><br/>7. Past experience, Please give server names so we can check: <br/>1) Arkana (arkana.ggservers.net:25587) I am a Dev (Developer) there.<br/>2) Zekam (108.163.227.219:25604) I was an admin, but the server was shutdown due to money related issues. <br/>3) I have had more staff/helper experience, but the servers have been forgotten since their closing.<br/><br/>8. Why you want Mediator, and what you will do with it. (Make it long - at least 6-7 sentences):<br/>I know I haven't been on for the required time of 1 month, but I decided to make this app. I really liked the staff, because they were very helpful (Dtiger, Chuble, Hbdz, Lazy, etc.). I looked up to them and watched how they solved the questions and problems that were handed to them. Not all staff are alike. I decided I should make an application for Mediator because they seemed they were missing a few (and that may not be the case). Even though, as a Guest-Dedicated (or even Contributor, Con+) you can still tell people not to do things, and guide them to the polite and respectful way of Minecraft, I have realized people for some reason listen to higher authority because they can do more. More commands are given as a Mediator, meaning, there is more responsibility given to the player (Me if this App gets accepted). In the responsibilities of a Med, almost all of those can be done by an average member of the server. The 4th responsibility however, gives you a bit of strength and force if they don't listen and don't follow what you say. Not only can I help with grief, but I can always help with answering questions, building, and fixing an issue related problem. A topic that is important on the server, is Anti-Grief. Although we have the &quot;No Griefing&quot; rule (sorta), people will still grief (normally because it's fun). The victim that got griefed is not always pleased. That's why Indistinct (v2) has staff to help find the griefer, arrest/ban the griefer, and if the player is asking for it rebuilt, rebuilding where it has been griefed. With Mediator, you can do a bit more than the average player. That is why it is deemed to the player (me) to make the application for Med to see if there is a need for another, or if they want me to be a Med. Not only am I capable (I think) of watching over the server while people are not here, but I can protect people from bad-mouth, getting called names (not like teasing, but worse), stealing, grief, and all the things that a Mediator should do. I do think I am ready for it, and I hope you all do as well.<br/><br/>9. Time Zone: EST (Eastern Standard Time)<br/><br/>Note- I wasn't sure if I should wait until Febuary 7th, or just apply now, so, I apologize for not waiting the required amount. Also, I have never been banned from Indistinct. And, to finish up, thank you for reading my Application for Mediator, I really hoped you liked it, and sorry for such a long writing thing for why I want Mediator (Probably was a pain to read).</div>
