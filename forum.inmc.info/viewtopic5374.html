<h3>NinjaBoy19's Mediator Application</h3>
<div class="date"><img src="styles/oxygen/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post"/>Posted: <strong>Tue Sep 10, 2013 11:09 pm</strong></div>

<div class="content">1. <span style="font-weight: bold">Ingame name:</span> NinjaBoy19<br/><br/>2. <span style="font-weight: bold">Rank:</span> Contributor<br/><br/>3. <span style="font-weight: bold">Age (Should be 12 or older):</span> 13 years old, 14 in upcoming Summer.<br/><br/>4. <span style="font-weight: bold">How long have you been playing on the server?:</span> About 9 months now, First joined in June 2013.<br/><br/>5. <span style="font-weight: bold">Play time:</span> Roughly 15 days (5 days of playtime before server reset, 10 days after server reset)<br/><br/>6. <span style="font-weight: bold">Are you active on the forums and/or on our teamspeak server?</span> I try to be active as much as I can on the forums, But ill get teamspeak if you need me to.<br/><br/>7. <span style="font-weight: bold">Past experience, Please give server names so we can check:</span> Mod on Hordecraft but that is down and Builder/Builder Manager on SurvivalCraft but that is down too.<br/><br/>8. <span style="font-weight: bold">Why you want Mediator, and what you will do with it. (Make it long - at least 6-7 sentences):</span><br/>I don't want to write here that I can help out by kicking, muting, or jailing players because that is common reason found in every application. Any player is capable of being a good staff member if they wanted to. Any player on the server can always help out his fellow player with crafting, answering their questions or even go as far as help with their personal problems. I want to be a Mediator because I want to be that specific person that any player on the server can come to and know they will get the best answer possible. Most of Minecraft's community is full of Pvpers, Survivors (Just surviving), Parkour masters, Redstoners, Miners, Farmers, Fishermen, and can't leave out the Griefers/Raiders. I am only one of the couple players who like to build on Indistinct and Minecraft in general and I would like to change that. I want to be a Mediator to teach players how to build. With my building knowledge, I will teach players how to improve in their building skills or how to build in general. Since most players find joy in raiding and destroying others property, Teaching them how to build will show them that they can find joy in building rather than demolishing. This will decrease the population of Griefers and increase the population of Builders. I would also like it if anyone would help me teach players with building (I'm looking at you Keag). I'm not as online as Keagan but I believe that a building school would greatly impact the server and Minecraft community.<br/><br/>9. <span style="font-weight: bold">Time zone:</span> Central Time Zone, I live in the US<br/><br/>10. <span style="font-weight: bold">Ways of communication(Steam/Email/etc):</span> <br/>Steam: NinjaNard <br/>Email:  <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#b4dad5c6d0d9ddc5c1d1f4cdd5dcdbdb9ad7dbd9"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6c020d1e0801051d19092c150d040303420f0301">[email&#160;protected]</span><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">

When I first joined, I fell almost instantly in love with Indistinct in my first hour (Everyone does!) but being the crazed MC fan-boy I was at that time and the instant love I had for Indistinct, I signed up for Mediator even though I barely had any experience. 9 months and 4 Applications later (all being denied), I look back at my old applications (I kinda copy/pasted some of them on a Notepad doc.) and facepalm myself so many times. I regret that decision I made almost a year ago and everytime I log in, I remember and wish they were never posted. I'm not sure if Dtiger or Chuble have gotten over it, but I really hate what I did back in June.</div>

<div class="content">Dtiger,<br/><br/>I can't tell if you are ignoring my app. on purpose for what happened in June, or just an honest mistake of not seeing it. I would think that when you are browsing around the forums and see that I have applied (again), You think in your head &quot;Oh, this kid again&quot; and you don't bother to read it. But if you are still reading up to this point, thank you. I am just another ignorant, stubborn, 13 year old who plays Minecraft like many others, But when I am given the chance to moderate such a wonderfully created server and thriving community beside you and the epic staff, I would try my hardest to exceed your expectations Dtiger and live up to my rank. Every application back in June was considered spam in your eyes along with Chuble's but in each of those apps. I truly wanted to help. If you were to accept me into the staff Dtiger, It would be an honor. But if I am denied, I have let myself down.</div>
