<h3>My proposed Idea [Revived]</h3>

<div class="content">When i'm online, Usually you will find me building something for someone or just mindless building for fun. Friends and players on Indistinct usually come to me for building advice or help on their build, which I do help them. Since this is the only thing I do on the server is building (Don't worry, I like doing it) and I assist people on doing so, I would want to propose a staff rank directed to building.<br/><br/>On my most recently posted med app.* I said that Minecraft is full of Pvpers, Survivors (Just surviving), Parkour masters, Redstoners, Miners, Farmers, Fishermen, Mini-game players, and can't leave out the Griefers/Raiders which are the main problem to Indistinct. Notice I didn't say Builders, Which I think are rare players to find in the huge online world of Minecraft. I say this because a majority of all Minecrafters find joy in griefing and raiding. Now there is a handful of players (I could be wrong) that do have a passion of building as much as I do but don't have the right Technics or advice while building. If there was someone specific to help that player in building, I would say that would be me.Teaching a griefer/raider how to build could possibly show them that there is also joy in building things up instead of tearing them down. When people think of staff, they think of your usual Moderators and Admins, But I believe that there should be staff dedicated to other things to, Like finances for the server or advertising, or even advisers to players. I would like a certain rank to distinguish me as an adviser to building, so players can know who they can come to for their building help, instead of not knowing what to do with their house or building and not improving it any further. I'm not asking for any moderating commands or perks, but just a name to distinguish myself. I already help friends with building but only my friends know that I like to build, new players don't know that I like to build unless we get to know each other more, and sometimes I see new people come. If there were any official buildings that needed to be built (Say the server needed a new building for a jail, which it does), I could also help with those too and assist Zenparadox.<br/><br/>To conclude and summarize, I would like to be part of the staff as a Building adviser to help players with their builds and lower down griefing and raiding with my building abilities. If anyone would like to propose anymore ideas to this topic or want to change something, go ahead I want to see how far this goes <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile"/> <br/>What do you think Dtiger?<br/><br/>-Ninja<br/><br/>*Deleted</div>

<div class="content">Well, I do like the idea of a new rank for Building adviser. I think the &quot;Builder&quot; rank isn't really such a builder rank, more as a semi-experienced player who should have already built something to survive and provide materials for themselves. Also, I think we should have more ranks that way we can expand the server, also, what/who is Zenparadox? Also, I don't necessarily see how you could teach a griefer to be nice, but okay. lol. I don't know why it says &quot;*Deleted&quot; either, if you could explain that. I like your idea, and I hope it can become reality soon <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"/></div>

<div class="content">There is a star right next to med app. and it was deleted. Zennparadox is the guy who built Indistinct's spawn in the old and new world.<br/><br/>I just really want to encourage more people to build because I don't usually find many building enthusists. On youtube, I sometimes see a couple building teams that have building montages on their channel, but they arn't much known because everyone is into mini-games and surviving and destroying! Maybe I can't change a griefer or raider's ways, but I could probably teach other minecrafters who arn't into demolishing buildings.</div>

<div class="content">Um, this is a good idea. I personally agree with this because I am a builder myself and have noticed the same things Ninja has been. So, this would be cool. LOL</div>
