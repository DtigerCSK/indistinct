<div class="content">I just happened to scroll through all of the Applications yet again (you know where this is going). It seems as though there's a large amount of applications sitting there without an answer back. You need to read through their apps and give them some constructive criticism about their apps. Dtiger, if it's too overwhelming for just YOU to accept/deny apps, then you should allow some of the Admins to go through and check these apps. Just a thought...</div>

<div class="content">While some of the Mediator Applications are good and bad, there is one problem with people getting accepted into staff. This problem is the lack of players. I am not proposing that we need hundreds of players crawling out of the woodwork on Indistinct, but a few more players makes more applications get accepted. Practically half of the dedicated members of Indistinct are staff. The other half are players. We would not want the majority of the players as staff because they would not have authority over hardly anybody. For example, if you have ten police officers are patrolling a mall with only three civilians in it, there would not be much action. However, if there were ten police officers patrolling a mall with fifty civilians in it, more police officers would be called in just in case bad things start to occur. I am not in favor of the unanswered applications graveyard, but there really is not much of anything to say. The decision is the following: An unanswered application graveyard or only a certain time where you can apply for staff. The second decision would probably anger many players in Indistinct. Also, just because you do not have a staff rank over your head, does not mean that you can't help. For example, I constantly welcome new players, and ask if they need any help or have any questions, as well as helping and answering questions. It is not about desperately wanting staff just to have it. It is about how worthy and truly helpful you are to the server.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>~TheExpertz</div>
