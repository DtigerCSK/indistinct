<h3>I_AM_A_NERD_123's mediator application</h3>
<div class="date"><img src="styles/oxygen/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post"/>Posted: <strong>Sun Oct 20, 2013 2:23 pm</strong></div>
<div class="author">by <strong>1amanerd123</strong></div>
<div class="content">1. ingame name: My ingame name is I_AM_A_NERD_123 <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_geek.gif" alt=":geek:" title="Geek"/> <br/><br/>2. rank: My rank is builder.<br/><br/>3. Age (Should be 12 or older): I am 12<br/><br/>4. How long have you been playing on the server?: I've been playing on indistinct for about 2 months and then I took a break for about a month because my computer was broken.<br/><br/>5. playtime: I've been playing for about 4 days and some. I have played 100 hours.<br/><br/>6. Are you active on the forums?: I am now. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad"/> I check every single day.<br/><br/>7. Past experience, Please give server names so we can check: No experience of being anything better than a member. I've never wanted to be a mod anywhere else because no server was ever anything like Indistinct. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"/> <br/><br/>8. Why you want Mediator, and what you will do with it. (Make it long - at least 6-7 sentences): I want to be a mediator because I believe that the server should be free of cyber-bullying and spam (even though the server is the best server ever!). I can spot cyber-bullying because I've been bullied all my life. This server should be a place where you are safe. Spotting spam like &quot;the fox&quot; spam or &quot;hash-tag&quot; spam is very important along with spotting disrespect. I've noticed that sometimes there's someone just going around being disrespectful in every-way humanly possible while there's no the mediators, mods, or admin on. Being disrespectful and cyber-bullying has become a mundane action for most people and I believe I can help stop it. I also am fun, I can take a joke. I really love this server, But staff aren't on very often other than Sammy and Gamer. All the staff on indistinct are really nice and cool, but I'm really sad that Chuble hasn't been on often, he's one of my favorite people on indistinct. I like it when new people come on the server, But when I say do /rules most of then ignore me and say something mean back. I would like a little more authority, if you guys choose me I'd be honored, but you have the right to demote me if needed. I don't want to be that formal annoying staff person that's always following you and saying stuff like &quot;DON'T DO THAT!&quot; ( thank gosh that Indistinct doesn't have any staff like that.) I want To be a friend someone you can talk to, someone like a best friend or family member that doesn't bug you. I also want to keep greifing at minimum, greifing has increased lately, I have to keep waiting for a staff member to come on to see who greifed, I understand that I can't ban now but for now I would be able jail the person and then got someone else to ban them. I want indistinct to be the way it was when I first joined, today (december 5 2013) I found 8 greifs, I want to see the indistinct I met when I first joined. No greifs, safety, no fear that one player might come back online, no more disrespect. I do not like some of the new people, maybe a spawn system, where they cant leave till they read and agree to the rules. I'm a nerd, im shy, very shy, I cannot seem to talk to most people, but on indistinct I felt like I was safe and free to talk and be happy. Yes, I was automatically intimidated by DTiger and Chuble but I got over it. I saw Chubles house today, I found it was greifed, I was very dismayed by it, <img src="images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very Sad"/> But I still think I can help. We need more Staff. We need lots of protection on indistinct form newer players who just come online to greif.<br/><br/><br/>9. Time zone: I live in new mexico therefore my time zone is UTC-7:00 or &quot;mountain time-zone&quot;<br/><br/>10. I am a girl<br/><br/>11. I hope I didn't bore you to death <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"/></div>
