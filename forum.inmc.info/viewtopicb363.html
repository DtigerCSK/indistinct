(Make it long):</span> <br/>Intro: Hello, Indistinct. This is my Mediator application. In this application I will be proposing the following: Why I would like to become a Mediator, What I will do with the Mediator rank, etc. Let's get started.<br/><br/>Topic 1: I want to become a Mediator because I have been on the server for a very long time. I have helped (or attempted to help) players over the year that I have been with Indistinct. I believe that the server could use another helpful staff member with my capabilities. Also, the rank would be an honor to earn.<br/><br/>Topic 2: I will use the Mediator rank by using my powers to enforce the rules of Indistinct, and to stop any arguing, profanity, racism, etc. I will also stop the &quot;wrong-doers&quot; of Indistinct. I have started using the HE tool to find griefers that haven't been banned using the ban page, so they can receive their consequences, as well. I don't want to see any &quot;free passers&quot; getting away with this stuff. I've seen griefers online wrong-doing, and I have been on the server watching griefers grief, and having to wait for another person to get online for the consequences to be enforced upon them. It is not fun watching people break the server you love and have been dedicated to. <br/><br/>Conclusion: In conclusion, I believe I deserve this rank, not because I desire it, but because I believe I can prevent any further negativity in the server. Above, I have explained why I would like to become a Mediator, and what I will do with it. Thank you for giving me so many opportunities in this server, and I appreciate the time that you are taking to read my Mediator App.<br/><br/>Extra (Ban Info): Yes, I know that I have been banned. Here are the explanations of why I was previously banned.[PREVIOUS BANS EXPLAINED: #1. contribution Chargeback: MrPibbz' fault #2.Get the ---- away from this server!: hdbz messed up #3. cats: I asked chuble to ban me, so I can get away from some drama on the server for five minutes.]<br/><br/>9. <span style="font-weight: bold">Time zone:</span> Central<br/><br/>10. <span style="font-weight: bold">Ways of communication:</span> Minecraft, PSN (TheExpertz), Twitter (@TheExpertz_)</div>

<div class="content">Thank you for complementing me on my Mediator Application. It means a lot. I do not care if I make it or not. I do what I can to help the server regardless of a rank. (Answering questions for new guests. Asking if anyone needs help, or if they have questions, etc.) Again, thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>~TheExpertz<br/>A.K.A. <span style="color: #FF0000">Evil</span><span style="color: #FFBF00">_</span><span style="font-style: italic"><span style="color: #00FF00">Envy</span></span><br/><br/>Quick Edit...<br/><br/>Thank you for actually giving me the opportunity to apply for staff, and listening to what your server community wants. (Such as implementing Legit Survival. If you don't know how to get there it is /warp legit) Lots of servers don't give you the opportunity to apply for staff, and they choose their staff. Big community servers do not listen to their communities and ignore them. Those servers are more worried about how many contribution features they can add in. I understand that funding is what keeps the server going, but they are money-scrapers. So, yes. Thank you. It means so much to me that you actually have more than zero fucks to give about your server. Not one of those servers are as good as yours because of these reasons. I've come to the point where when you have a question and ask and they say you're annoying and ban you. So thank you Dtiger. Thanks for welcoming me into this server as a minecraft noob with your inviting community that didn't call me a noob, although I had clearly just got the game. Showing me how to craft, mine, etc. Even the fact that you added earn able ranks and you can still look at V1 shows that you are superior. You didn't just trash our builds, and hand us a new world. You let us go back and look back on it. <br/><br/>I don't care how many players you have. How great is your server? No, not your enormous contribution features that are overpriced and irrelevant, or big community that doesn't know each other.<br/>It's an honor Dtiger.<br/>Yours truly,<br/>~Trevor</div>
