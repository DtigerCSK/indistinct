<div class="content">1. purple_paradox22<br/>2. receiving spawned items<br/>3. hbdz<br/>4. i did read the rules and thought i read that it was wrong but when i was going to build my factions base i told killerdean or somebody( i think it was him) and he spawned in diamond blocks 4 me, i asked if it was illegal and he said &quot;no just asking for ranks and gm&quot; i said ok and that was that. then today i asked keagan to spawn in more so i could keep on working on my faction's base, then he said he couldn't i thought he meant he didnt have the rank to do so. then i asked wolf-something and then keagen said that he could read msg's and i still didnt get it. so then i was tp'd to the jail and Sammy or &quot;hbdz&quot; started yelling at me and i started to explain that i thought it was ok but they banned me.<br/>5.i didn't know and i didn't ask for some in the first place, he gave them to me i thought it was a rule not to but i was miss informed.<br/>6. i love this server and the people on it, ive made friends and spent allot of time. i really like you guys and i don't want to get on your bad side</div>

<div class="content">When I was speaking to you, you said you asked Killeradean for blocks to help build your faction base. Normally, by being on the server for a while, you learn that accepting spawned items and absolutely CANNOT spawn items for others. Hbdz (AKA Sammy) was &quot;yelling&quot; at you because you had been told before it is not allowed, and she then banned you for your actions.<br/><br/>Before this all happened, you asked me to spawn you in some diamond blocks for you. I rejected and said no, I am not allowed to spawn in items for other players. After being told no from me, you then decided to ask WolfShadow57 for him to spawn you diamond blocks. He politely said, &quot;No, if I did give you diamond blocks, I would get banned for spawning items for you.&quot; I don't necessarily see how you didn't understand how spawning items for lower ranks was prohibited.<br/><br/>Rule #3 (/warp rules) states, &quot;Do not ask for OP/GM/Ranks/etc.&quot; This also includes items, but it is not specifically stated. I can see why Killeradean told you that spawning items is allowed.</div>

Probably made it too vague also. :p</div>
