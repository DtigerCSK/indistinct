<div class="content">How does everyone feel in their own honest opinion on the uprising of the population of African American's also widely known as Negroes? And their possibility of taking over all of America? And if it is not African American's that worry you, what about the common issue of many Latino's crossing the American Boarder? No racism is intended whatsoever in this post but I would much appreciate honest feelings about these problems we face in America, thank you.</div>

<div class="content">I feel like they're not taking over, but the news expands on dumb sh*t about how black(s) skinned people are targeted by police. It does stink that some of these people take our jobs, but that is because some of us are not trying hard enough to get that job. And, there is always the thing about over-population where we don't have enough jobs/homes as we do people living. But of course, people think their money is unlimited, and realize while they're staring at the ground holding a sign, they soon realize what they did wrong.</div>

<div class="content">Well Keagan, of course the Police Department doesn't hold up a sign saying 'Help wanted, part-time job as a Police officer' and just hire anyone. But it does seem like it. It is more of a racial issue and this problem here is noticed by many ordinary people like us but no one does anything to go any farther to stop it.</div>

<div class="content">The border isn't regulated properly... Hmm wonder what this could cause? How about hidden Isis agents sneaking over the borders without authentification? These agents now are in the US, but are &quot;nonexistent&quot;. We are doing nothing about our own people being murdered in Syria and are allowing them in the US because somebody doesn't want a job keeping watch over the border. I'm 15 and I have a job. We have some lazy people back home cheating welfare and not worried about a job. It's sad that I have to pay tax from my paycheck for a lazy cheapskate to continue to be lazy. I'm not talking about paying for people who are retired. I actually strongly support that. I'm not talking about the people who actually need welfare. I'm not complaining about taxes because I'm actually helping put another meal on somebody I don't know's plate. Which makes me feel great every two weeks on that Friday when I get that check. Black people stealing our jobs... Black Americans don't steal our jobs. They are entitled to all the rights a white person has. It all travels back to discrimination. Think about your rights. You have freedom of speech, religion, press, assembly, petition, to own a gun. You know what would happen if you went to North Korea and said something about the government? You'd be shot on the spot. Several countries don't allow guns including our friends up north in Canada. You know what happens in the Middle East of you don't agree to their religion? You are killed. Women can't go outside without a man, in fact, their sons have more of a right than them. A lot of things are wrong in this world. So enjoy that the U.S. actually sets a minimum wage. Enjoy that this government has survived over 200 years. Enjoy that you have access to the Internet.</div>

I think these kinds of stories are over exaggerated. When the Ferguson Shooting actually happened, I couldn't even browse the internet without seeing a story about it there. I initially thought race could have been a factor for the shooting, (Mind you, this was before the reports were released) but when I started looking more into it, I could see that it was obviously an assault on the officer, not a race killing. All this &quot;Hands up&quot; bullshit is based on lies. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensationalism" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensationalism</a> He never put his hands up in a surrendering pose. As proven by DNA and witness reports, after he assaulted the officer in his patrol car, he charged the officer, and was shot.<br/>I would also advise you to also look at this <a href="https://www.odmp.org/search/year" class="postlink">https://www.odmp.org/search/year</a><br/>Officers have been killed on a daily basis, but this is largely overlooked by the media and most of the people that have participated in the riots. You need to check the facts before making up your mind on a subject such as this.<br/><br/><blockquote class="uncited"><div>what about the common issue of many Latino's crossing the American Boarder</div></blockquote><br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol</a><br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States" class="postlink">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States</a><br/><br/>Also does anyone even use the forum anymore? I feel like I am the only one checking it on a daily basis.</div>
