<div class="content">Hello, I am Sputters all of the server knows me as &quot;Spooters&quot; and I want to say --- we need to advertise the server alot more (dtiger) mainly because we only have 8 unique players on the server, not bad advertising like going onto servers and and spamming &quot;join fags&quot;. No, we need to continue the advertising I know 10 unique players are good --- but I KNOW we can do better on advertising I have some ideas; Adding Plugins (prison), even doing CONTESTS for the server like skin contest another building contest the best redstone contest. That creates a community, an entertainment between the players and the staff to the server it will create a list on whose the best player on the server. Like make a list to see who has the most Points and they can spend there points on stuff like; items, ranks, factions, etc. I would enjoy this too, I really lean on the &quot;prison&quot; server type of thing --- keep survival, minigames, etc and we can just add prison and make it another server. I can create that if you want, I will contribute for another server but put the server in the main server. so it will discontinue the ranks from the real server to that server. Or you can keep it all the same and just add a map with the prison plugin on and perms and just add like prison ranks like [Member][A] A is the base starting rank and it goes all the way to [C] rank and this will create a &quot;I NEED TO GET TO THAT LEVEL!!!!!!!&quot; type of thing, I really recommend it. and if permissions cant work then just add the permission rank so when you enter the world you will get your rank as soon as you join THAT MAP.<br/><br/><br/>-Spooters (p.s please read dtiger)</div>

<div class="content">I definitely agree. Although, I don't think Minigames is a great idea just yet. We can't have minigames without players. So... Let's get more players before introducing minigames. I would definitely love Prison or something. I can help build some stuff and do commands and such.<br/><br/>P.S. Even though &quot;5th page is just like 200th page&quot; on voting sites, it would be a good idea. Just to try, we need to at least make an effort instead of saying &quot;nah it doesn't work&quot; and be lazy about it.</div>

<div class="content">Nowadays there are too many minecraft servers out there, due to minecraft server hosts making it too easy for 12 year olds to take their parent's credit card and purchase their own server. Minecraft itself is also becoming saturated with 12 year olds. As of right now, there are <a href="http://mcstats.org/global/" class="postlink">125,000+ minecraft servers</a>, with a peak of around 400k players and at near 100k lowest. If all players were spread out evenly there would be only like 4 players per server, but we don't see that do we? The only popular servers are those massive ones with custom gamemodes, custom minigames, custom plugins, custom everything, making them 100%-ish unique. What do we have that others don't? Not much. Unless there's some unique and brilliant idea that can get us lotta players, we won't be that unique. However, I did have some server types that are pretty unique and shouldn't be too hard to create with scripting, but I don't have the time to work on anything nor the motivation to do so. Maybe during summer. Maybe not.<br/><br/>Nearly every minigame that is available for the public to download are incredibly overused, such as Survival Games, Mob Arena, etc., so minigames aren't going to be implemented anytime soon as they will just add more things to maintain, as well as spread players out over the server which lowers the interaction between players and community of the server. <br/><br/>The only place that actually brings players is Planetminecraft, which if you have not noticed already, brings quite a few of unwanted guests. Planetminecraft has a system where you can bump a server to the top of the list every 24 hours, and is one of the few server listings that has this feature. Other server lists only get new players to join within the hour you post the server, and only during that. The server post will just die along with the other thousands of dead postings. Most server lists are dominated by the servers that pay for a &quot;sponsored&quot; spot, which costs up to $800-$1,000. The voting section's first 30-50 pages have few hundred to several thousand votes, which we will never get close to. Realistically, people rarely even go past first few pages, so unless we magically get few thousand votes within a month, voting does not help <span style="font-style: italic">at all</span>.<br/><br/>Prison servers has been around for a few years already, and every prison server seemingly has the <span style="font-style: italic">exact</span> same layout, ranks A to something, then free. Prison servers don't exactly have much ways of being unique, which is the prime way of making players stay... unless someone has a really good idea that can be done within our ranges. Also, the extra prison server would mean more maintenance, needs more moderation, more work to do. <span style="font-style: italic">One server is already more than enough for me to maintain, another one would require a staff member who <span style="font-weight: bold">actually</span> knows how to operate and run a server successfully, not just in game moderation/administration.</span><br/><br/>Contests should help as it does give players something to do, but last time's contest didn't go so well. Around 4 people entered and there were 3 winners. Obviously having the near same amount of winners and people who enter isn't exactly very ideal, but contests will most likely still appear later on.<br/><br/>The points system would just be the economy(?). In order to keep it fair it would have to be reset every once in a while, as inflation does take it's toll on minecraft servers often. Many players don't like resets as it makes them lose all their progress and may chose to leave, just like how a specific server had reset it's map several times and now is nearly dead due to the players that had quit.</div>

<div class="content">I see where you're getting at &quot;same shit&quot; but we can make it different --- BETTER even, like after [C] rank you will be reset, but you will have your perks; 100k going back into [A] rank and after every month we reset the ranks and add a rank to make this harder, even that thing &quot;I NEED TO GET TO THE NEW RANK FIRST!!!!&quot; this creates a better economy between the server and players --- they will have the feeling of getting it first, even we add a list on who got to [C] rank first whoever got to [D] rank next. I really REALLY truly believe we need this plugin, on the forums we will create a list of people who got to the ranks first. <br/><br/>So let me talk about how this prison plugin will work --- you join the prison map, and you will be AUTOMATICALLY set to [A] rank it takes 100K to get to [B] rank then 1million to get to [C] rank as i said &quot;every month we reset the ranks and add a rank&quot; so it will be harder every month. every rank upgrade you need 500k more and its a rinse and repeat type of thing but HARDER staff members will not be set to the top rank at first, that will create a fucking hard ass thing to catch up to for regular players. Then there should be a list on the website too see who got to [B]rank first or [C]rank first. if you contribute you get a kit that gives you Iron gear and /feed --- or something more buffed or nerfed (up to you) (dtiger), Please accept this plugin!<br/><br/>-Spooters (p.s i can add more ideas for the prison server if needed)</div>
